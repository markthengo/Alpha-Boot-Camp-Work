Writing in Markdown and writing the best way to provide quality code
================================================

> - Write with comments about what this is doing and main terms to tell what a function is doing
> - Its about keeping your indentation style consistent
> - Try to not write too obvious comments 
> - How you group your code is important as too functions within a function would make things confusing 
> - Have a consistent naming theme
> - Don't repeat tasks

**Other things to take note are**
- Try to avoid deep nesting 
- limit your line length so it doesn't spill over and look untidy 
- Use a proper file structure for your framework 
- Use capitals for your SQL    
- Separation of code and data 
- Use descriptive names 
- Keep a consistent coding style
